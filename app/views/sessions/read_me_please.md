OK so here's the deal.

In this lab all the controller stuff is already handeled by the "ApplicationController"
but if it wasn't, and if you were using the "UsersController" along with the
"ApplicationController" in real life, then you'd want to have a seperate "sessions"
folder and a "users" folder for their respective views.
